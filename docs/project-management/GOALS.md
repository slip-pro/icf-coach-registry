## Future Goals (by priority)

### G-024: Update WordPress Links — Done (moved to Achieved)

### G-023: Photo Upload Rework — Done (moved to Achieved)

### G-011: Coach Profile Editing — Done (moved to Achieved)

### G-025: White-Label Product (Reusable Registry)
**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: 🔴 High
**Description**: Refactor the registry into a configurable white-label product that can be deployed for other coaching schools and organizations. A coaching school requested their own copy. Need to extract ICF Cyprus-specific branding, data sources, and config into a separate layer so the core engine is reusable. Each instance gets its own: branding (logo, colors, fonts), Google Sheet, domain, i18n overrides.

**Done so far**:
- [x] Settings sheet in Google Sheets — single source of truth for all config
- [x] Apps Script reads config from Settings (getSettings, getConfig action)
- [x] Vercel API endpoint `/api/config` — serves frontend config with 5-min cache
- [x] Frontend loads config on init, applies CSS variables (colors, fonts)
- [x] i18n brand override — `setBrandOverrides()` replaces "ICF Cyprus" with configured brand name
- [x] Full Google URLs accepted for Drive folder and Sheet (auto-parsed to IDs)
- [x] Logo URL in Settings — remote logo from Google Drive, overrides local config
- [x] Debug details removed from /api/config error responses
- [x] Apps Script URL moved to Vercel env var (APPS_SCRIPT_URL)
- [x] All hardcoded "ICF Cyprus" removed from HTML titles and success page
- [x] Page titles set dynamically from remote config (registryName)
- [x] success.html reads brand from config cache
- [x] Deployment guide for new instances (docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

**Remaining**:
- [ ] Test with a second instance (the coaching school)

### G-006: Conference Landing Workflow
**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium
**Description**: Workflow for potential clients from conference to access the registry. Details TBD.


### G-012: ICF Membership Expiration Tracking
**Status**: Backlog (needs input from chapter admin)
**Priority**: 🟢 Low
**Description**: Track when a coach's ICF chapter membership expires and auto-hide or flag them in the registry. Need to understand from the responsible colleague: how membership data is tracked, is there an API/export, what's the renewal cycle.
**Action**: Ask responsible colleague about membership tracking process before designing solution.

### G-003: AI Coach Matching Assistant
**Status**: Deferred
**Priority**: 🟢 Low (Phase 2)
**Description**: AI chatbot widget that helps clients find the right coach through a short conversation.

### G-004: Analytics & Optimization
**Status**: Deferred
**Priority**: 🟢 Low (Phase 2)
**Description**: Track page views, filter usage, contact clicks, and AI conversation conversion.

### G-015: Migrate Infrastructure to ICF Cyprus Account
**Status**: Backlog
**Priority**: 🟢 Low (Phase 2+)
**Description**: Move all infrastructure from personal account to official ICF Cyprus account: Google Sheet, Google Drive (photos), Apps Script, Vercel project, GitHub repo. Currently everything runs under the personal account of the board member who set it up.
**Action**: Coordinate with ICF Cyprus admin to create/transfer ownership.

### G-017: Unit + Integration Tests
**Status**: Backlog
**Priority**: 🟢 Low (Phase 2+)
**Description**: Add test coverage for the widget. Unit tests for pure logic (CSV parsing, filters, i18n, URL validation, HTML escaping). Integration tests for DOM rendering (cards, filters, language switch, form validation). Simple HTML test runner — no npm/Node required.

### ~~G-005: Embed Widget in WordPress~~
**Status**: Cancelled
**Reason**: WP platform strips `<script>` tags. Custom domain `coaches.icf-cyprus.com` solves the problem — no need to embed. WP page links to the registry externally.

## Achieved Goals

### G-011: Coach Profile Editing
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 2
**Completed**: 2026-05-10

Coaches can edit their existing profile via email magic link. Coach enters email on the edit page, receives a one-time link (UUID token, 24h expiry), clicks it to open a pre-filled form with all their data. Changes are saved directly to Google Sheet.

**Auth**: Magic link via email — no passwords or accounts needed. Rate limited to 1 email per 5 minutes. Token is single-use and expires in 24h. Only approved coaches can request a link.

**Architecture**: Frontend (`src/js/edit.js`, `src/edit.html`) → Vercel proxies (`api/request-edit-link.js`, `api/verify-token.js`, `api/save-profile.js`) → Apps Script (`handleRequestEditLink`, `handleVerifyToken`, `handleSaveProfile`) → Google Sheet (`EditTokens` tab for tokens, `Submissions` tab for data).

**Settings sheet**: Apps Script now reads configuration (sender name, admin email, site URL, Drive folder ID, registry name) from a `Settings` sheet in Google Sheets instead of hardcoded values. Enables white-label reuse.

**Changes**:
- `src/js/edit.js` — edit profile module (3 states: email entry, link sent, edit form)
- `src/edit.html` — edit page
- `src/js/app.js` — added 'edit' view
- `src/js/i18n.js` — 17 new edit-related keys (EN/RU/EL)
- `src/styles/main.css` — edit page styles
- `api/request-edit-link.js` — Vercel proxy for requesting magic link
- `api/verify-token.js` — Vercel proxy for token verification
- `api/save-profile.js` — Vercel proxy for saving profile (10MB limit)
- `docs/APPS_SCRIPT_FULL_CODE.js` — complete Apps Script with Settings sheet support
- Apps Script: action dispatcher in `doPost`, 4 handlers, `getSettings()`, `createSettingsSheet()`

### G-024: Update WordPress Links
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 2
**Completed**: 2026-05-10

Created a new "Find a Coach – NEW" page on the ICF Cyprus WordPress site with links to the custom domain `coaches.icf-cyprus.com` (catalog) and `coaches.icf-cyprus.com/src/register.html` (registration).

---

### G-023: Photo Upload Rework
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 2
**Completed**: 2026-05-10

Replaced URL-based photo input with direct file upload in registration form. Coach selects a photo from their device (JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 5 MB), it's converted to base64 in the browser, sent via Vercel serverless proxy to Google Apps Script, which decodes and saves to Google Drive. Thumbnail URL stored in Google Sheet column E.

**Changes**:
- `src/js/registration.js` — file input with preview, client-side validation, base64 conversion
- `src/js/i18n.js` — new keys for photo upload UI (EN/RU/EL)
- `src/styles/main.css` — photo upload styling
- `api/submit.js` — JSON body (instead of URLSearchParams), 10 MB body limit, new Apps Script URL
- Apps Script `doPost` — reads `e.postData.contents`, decodes base64, saves to Drive
- `src/register.html` — updated Apps Script URL

**Key fix**: URLSearchParams truncated large base64 payloads. Switched to JSON body with `text/plain` content type.

---

### G-018: Coach Profile Modal
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-09

Clicking a coach card opens a modal with the full profile: complete bio (no truncation), tags, meta info, and contact buttons. Modal closes via X button, backdrop click, or Escape key. On mobile the modal renders as a bottom sheet (85vh max). Cards show cursor:pointer for clickability. i18n key `closeModal` added for EN/RU/EL.

**Files changed**: `src/js/cards.js`, `src/styles/main.css`, `src/js/i18n.js`

---

### G-019: Registration Form Fix (Apps Script Redeployment)
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-09

Apps Script endpoint was broken (page not found error). User redeployed the script with a new deployment. Documentation updated: `docs/GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.md` now uses `e.parameter.payload` instead of `e.postData.contents` for correct parameter handling.

**Files changed**: `docs/GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.md`

---

### G-020: Remove ICF Membership Field from Registration
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-09

Removed Section 7 (ICF Membership Number) from the registration form entirely. Field removed from data collection. Coaches no longer need to provide membership info during registration.

---

### G-021: Avatar Photo Centering Fix
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-09

Added `object-position: center top` to `.icf-avatar` so that coach photos focus on the face/upper body rather than the center of the image. Fixes cropping issues with portrait photos.

**Files changed**: `src/styles/main.css`

---

### G-022: Browser-Based Modal Tests
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-09

Added `tests/modal.test.html` with 13 assertions covering modal open/close behavior, content rendering, keyboard navigation (Escape), and backdrop click. Simple HTML test runner — no npm/Node required, runs in any browser.

**Files changed**: `tests/modal.test.html`

---

### G-013: Registration Form Redesign + Bilingual Bio
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-05

Bilingual bio support: coaches write bio in 2 languages, catalog shows bio matching UI language (fallback: English → first bio). New Google Sheet column structure with Status as column A. Form updated with two bio fields + language selectors. Apps Script rewritten for new column order.

---

### G-014: Filter Cleanup + Translation
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-05

### G-016: Custom Domain
**Status**: Achieved
**Phase**: 1.5
**Completed**: 2026-04-14

Connected custom subdomain `coaches.icf-cyprus.com` to Vercel. Domain admin created CNAME record pointing `coaches` to `cname.vercel-dns.com`. Vercel auto-issued SSL certificate. Old URLs (`icf-cyprus-coaches.vercel.app`, `icf-coach-registry.vercel.app`) continue to work as aliases.

## Technical Debt

### TD-001: ARIA keyboard navigation in filter dropdown
**Problem**: Specialization dropdown uses `role="listbox"` but lacks arrow key navigation between options
**Fix**: Implement arrow key navigation or change to `role="group"`
**Priority**: Medium
**Source**: G-001 Sprint 1 (audit finding)

### TD-002: WhatsApp number country code assumption
**Problem**: WhatsApp normalization assumes Cyprus prefix (+357) for numbers starting with 0
**Fix**: Document assumption or require full international format
**Priority**: Low
**Source**: G-001 Sprint 1 (audit finding)

### TD-003: CSP compatibility for inline styles
**Problem**: Avatar placeholders use inline `style` attribute for dynamic colors — blocked by strict CSP
**Fix**: Move dynamic color to CSS variable via JS `.style` property
**Priority**: Low
**Source**: G-001 Sprint 1 (audit finding)
