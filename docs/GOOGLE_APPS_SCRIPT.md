# Google Apps Script — Backend

This guide explains how to set up the Google Apps Script web app that handles
coach registration, profile editing, and admin workflows.

## Full Source Code

**`docs/APPS_SCRIPT_FULL_CODE.js`** — single file with all functions.
Copy and paste the entire file into Apps Script.

## Prerequisites

- The same Google Sheet used for the coach directory
- A "Submissions" tab in that sheet
- Google account with owner/editor access to the sheet

## Setup

### 1. Create the Submissions tab

Add these column headers in the first row:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Status | Name | Email | ICF Level | Photo | Specializations | Languages | Format | Price Min | Price Max |

| K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bio 1 | Bio 1 Language | Bio 2 | Bio 2 Language | WhatsApp | Telegram | Instagram | LinkedIn | Facebook | ICF Membership | Submitted At |

### 2. Paste the script

1. In the Google Sheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**
2. Delete any default code (Ctrl+A → Delete)
3. Copy the entire contents of `docs/APPS_SCRIPT_FULL_CODE.js`
4. Paste into the editor

### 3. Create the Settings sheet

Run the function `createSettingsSheet` from the function dropdown (▶️ Run).
This creates a "Settings" sheet with default values:

**Backend settings:**

| Key | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| SENDER_NAME | ICF Cyprus | Display name for outgoing emails |
| ADMIN_EMAIL | _(fill in)_ | Email for admin notifications |
| SITE_URL | https://coaches.icf-cyprus.com | Base URL of the registry |
| EDIT_PAGE | /src/edit.html | Path to the edit page |
| DRIVE_FOLDER | https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/... | Google Drive folder for photos (full URL) |
| REGISTRY_NAME | ICF Cyprus Coach Registry | Full name shown in emails |

**Frontend settings (loaded by website on page load):**

| Key | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| BRAND_NAME | ICF Cyprus | Brand name shown in headers and text |
| COLOR_PRIMARY | #212251 | Main text/background color |
| COLOR_SECONDARY | #2b379b | Secondary/accent color |
| COLOR_ACCENT | #efcb30 | CTA buttons, highlights |
| COLOR_SURFACE | #f8f0e4 | Light background surfaces |
| FONT_HEADING | Nunito | Google Font for headings |
| FONT_BODY | Plus Jakarta Sans | Google Font for body text |
| LOCATION | Cyprus | Location for "Offline (Cyprus)" label |
| COUNTRY_CODE | +357 | Default country code for WhatsApp |
| SHEET_URL | https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/.../edit | Google Sheet with coach data (full URL) |

DRIVE_FOLDER and SHEET_URL accept full Google URLs — just paste the link from your browser. The script auto-extracts the ID.

For white-label deployments: change these values for each instance.

### 4. Set up the onEdit trigger

1. Click the **clock icon** in the left sidebar (Triggers)
2. Click **+ Add Trigger**
3. Choose which function to run: `colorByStatus`
4. Select event source: From spreadsheet
5. Select event type: On edit
6. Click **Save** and authorize

### 5. Run initial setup functions

1. Select `addStatusDropdown` → Run (adds dropdowns to Status column)
2. Select `colorAllRows` → Run (colors existing rows)

### 6. Deploy as web app

1. Click **Deploy > New deployment**
2. Select type: **Web app**
3. Execute as: **Me** / Who has access: **Anyone**
4. Click **Deploy** and authorize
5. Copy the Web app URL

### 7. Configure Vercel proxies

The web app URL must match in all Vercel API files:
- `api/submit.js`
- `api/request-edit-link.js`
- `api/verify-token.js`
- `api/save-profile.js`
- `api/config.js`

## Sheets Structure

### Submissions
Coach data — one row per coach. Column A (Status) controls visibility.

| Status | Color | Visible in catalog |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| `pending` | Yellow (#fff2cc) | No |
| `approved` | Green (#d9ead3) | Yes |
| `rejected` | Red (#f4cccc) | No |

### EditTokens
Auto-created on first edit link request.

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| A: Email | Coach's email (lowercase) |
| B: Token | UUID v4 |
| C: ExpiresAt | ISO timestamp (created + 24h) |
| D: Used | TRUE after profile is saved |

Rate limit: 1 token per email per 5 minutes.

### Board, Members
Who may sign in to the chapter website's admin, and who counts as an ICF member.
Auto-created on first `getPeople` call.

| Sheet | Columns |
|-------|---------|
| Board | `Email \| Name \| Role \| Expiration date \| Photo \| Bio` — blank date means a seat with no end; `Photo` and `Bio` feed the website's board block and are written by its admin |
| Members | `Email \| Name \| Member until` |

### Events, Articles, Partners
The chapter website's content. Auto-created on first `getContent` call. The site
reads them every five minutes; the board edits them either in the website admin
or directly here.

| Sheet | Columns |
|-------|---------|
| Events | `Slug \| Title \| Start \| End \| Category \| Location \| Cover \| Summary \| Description \| Fienta URL \| Gallery` |
| Articles | `Source URL \| Title \| Image \| Summary \| Tags \| Added at` |
| Partners | `Slug \| Name \| Kind \| URL \| Logo \| Summary \| Since` |

Three things worth knowing before editing by hand:

- **Columns are matched by their header text**, not position, so they can be
  reordered, and a column you add for your own notes survives a save from the admin.
- **A row added without a slug still works** — the slug is derived from the title.
- **Dates and times are stored as text on purpose.** Reformatting those cells as
  real dates makes Sheets reinterpret them: an event's `+03:00` offset is lost and
  it moves by hours.

### Settings
Configuration key-value pairs. Read by `getSettings()` on every request.
Falls back to defaults if sheet or key is missing.

Backend keys (used by Apps Script internally): SENDER_NAME, ADMIN_EMAIL, SITE_URL, EDIT_PAGE, DRIVE_FOLDER, REGISTRY_NAME, PEOPLE_API_SECRET.

`PEOPLE_API_SECRET` guards `getPeople` and all four content actions. The `/exec`
URL is public, so without it anyone holding that URL could read every email
address and rewrite the website's content. It must match the environment
variable of the same name on the chapter website.

Frontend keys (served to the website via `/api/config`): BRAND_NAME, COLOR_PRIMARY, COLOR_SECONDARY, COLOR_ACCENT, COLOR_SURFACE, FONT_HEADING, FONT_BODY, LOCATION, COUNTRY_CODE, SHEET_URL.

Sensitive keys (ADMIN_EMAIL, DRIVE_FOLDER) are NOT exposed to the frontend.

## How It Works

### Registration Flow
1. Coach fills form → Vercel proxy (`/api/submit`) → Apps Script
2. New row added to Submissions with status `pending` (yellow)
3. Admin gets email notification
4. Admin changes status to `approved` → row turns green → coach visible

### Edit Flow (Magic Link)
1. Coach enters email on edit page
2. `/api/request-edit-link` → Apps Script finds approved coach
3. UUID token generated, stored in EditTokens, email sent
4. Coach clicks link → `/api/verify-token` → profile data returned
5. Coach edits form → `/api/save-profile` → row updated, token marked used

### Photo Upload (base64)
1. Browser converts image to base64 (max 5 MB, JPEG/PNG/WebP)
2. Sent as JSON field `photoBase64` + `photoFilename`
3. Apps Script decodes, saves to Google Drive folder
4. Thumbnail URL stored in column E

## Updating the Deployment

After modifying the script:

1. **Deploy > Manage deployments**
2. Click the **✏️ pencil icon** on the active deployment
3. Version: select **New version**
4. Click **Deploy**

**Important**: Do NOT create a new deployment — it changes the URL.
Always edit the existing deployment.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No row appears after registration | Check Apps Script execution log (Executions sidebar) |
| Edit email not arriving | Check EditTokens tab was created. Check spam. Wait 5 min (rate limit). |
| Colors not updating | Verify onEdit trigger is set up (Triggers sidebar) |
| "Submissions tab not found" | Create tab named exactly "Submissions" |
| URL mismatch after redeployment | Update URL in all `api/*.js` files and push to Vercel |
